Custom setup for archiso images
===============================

This repository contains my customized variation of
[archiso](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Archiso) to build Arch Linux Live-CDs. 
I added a GUI (xfce) as well as some convenient apps for network analysis
* wireshark 
* nmap 
and cryptography 
* truecrypt 
* john
* tor
* ncrack
* aircrack-ng
